# Internet Kids

<p> Internet Kids is about a cyber war in the midst of its apex. The idea of this written piece is to play around the idea of virtually uploading our conscious minds into a data field, essentially giving humans immortality. Tripp, the main protagonist is faced with questions revolving around the philosophical wonders of soul in the machine. 

Each blog post is a new chapter in this journey through the hard drive as Tripp learns to navigate this place. His memory wiped and he only knows the former reality of where he once was.</p>

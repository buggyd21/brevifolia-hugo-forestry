<h1>Ep.1 – A Glitch</h1>

The café was filled with people. Some were working, studying while others where socializing. The aroma of coffee and eggs filled the coffee shop on this warm spring morning. I would peak up causally from my book to simply see how things were in the shop. If it was busy, slow, just general curiosity. Everything was how it was and should be for a Tuesday. I took a sip from my coffee when suddenly a weird line shot across my vision… like a television static when the screen starts to go bad. It was weird but my eyes could be going bad. The day went on as usual. I finished my reading drank the rest of my coffee and went back to work.

If you asked me what I did I honestly couldn’t tell you. I sat at a computer, looked at spreadsheets and pushed it along. My colleges and I had a typically speech act or script if you would.

“Hi Jenn, how are you?” I would say to her.

“Oh fine and dandy, and yourself?” Doing well, I would reply. Blah blah blah kids, blah blah weather. The conversation had no sustenance but its how we operated and got along. They paid my bills so could I really complain if the only torture was meaningless small talk to show hey I don’t really care to know you but I’ll acknowledge you. The daily routine went on of looking at spread sheets and pushing that forward. The clock made it’s way to 5pm and the work day came to an end.

“See you tomorrow.” Jenn said

“Right, see you tomorrow.” I replied.

We both left the workplace. I waited a few minutes to give her a head start leaving the building. No need pain myself with more robotic small talk than I typically do, right? That waiting period passed and I walked out making my way toward the elevator taking the 5th floor down to ground level. I walked up to my car a 2014 Toyota Prius, was great on gas… wasn’t the most comfortable. Either way, I hoped in and drove home I was only a mile away but I would get weird looks when I would ride my bike in. No need to make enemies or friends in a place you don’t care for. But I made it home, made dinner, and went for a walk and called it night. This was my routine day in and day out. I had the weekends off and I used that time to get things done around the house. Laundry, cleaning, house upkeep and so on. Was I happy? No, but I wasn’t sad I was just living. Life was stale nothing like the movies but that’s not what life is.

The rest of the week came around and it was pretty much the same. A causal hello to Jenn and pushing spreadsheets with numbers and data. I kept seeing that weird line static coming across my sight though and it becoming more and more prominent. During my time off I went to the doctor and I got a prescription for glasses. They helped but when I would take them off I would see that line again and it was getting bigger it would remain in view longer, and I was getting worried. The doctor was baffled. He recommended that I get lazer eye surgery to fix the problem. I was all for it until I saw the cost of it all. Sadden by this I went back home that Sunday. When I woke the next morning and went into work I was called into HR.

“Good morning how are you today?” Jenn asked.

“I’m doing well. Yourself?” I replied. _I hope she gets to the point soon._

“I know you’re busy so I’ll cut to the chase”

_Oh, thank god_

“It’s good news. We recently had a change in our insurance policy allowing vision to be fully covered. We recognized stairing at a screen all day isn’t the best for one’s eyes and coverage goes farther than a simple prescription to glasses. It now covers as far as lasik eye surgery up to $3,000 dollars.” Jenn says with enthusiasm. “Oh and if you need to take time off to take care of the surgery, go right ahead, I won’t doc it from your PTO or anything.” She says with a wink.

“This is good Jenn, my eyes are not what they use to be. I’ll schedule an appointment for tomorrow.” I saw with a false tone of excitement. It’s not that I wasn’t grateful, I just did not feel like doing it.

“Please, take all the time you… but the sooner the better.” She replied with a crooked smile.

I went home that night, made dinner my regular pasta complemented with the pleasant dessert of ice cream. The beauty of the raspberry swirl was glistened by the frozen ice shards that sparkled from the light in the room. I passed out around my normal bedtime.

…

“Tripp! Tripp!!! Wake up!”

SMACK

“What the hell?!?” I woke to two people standing in front of me wearing some sort of body armor, they were twins one with a pink mohawk and the other with a lime green. We were on some vehicle, floating and we were driving away from another vehicle. They were shooting right above us.

BOOM

Smoke erupts from the the back end of our vessel as we go down.

…

I wake up in the middle of the night. Covered in sweat. It was about 2am. _I must be nervous about the surgery._ I got up and drank some water before going back to bed.

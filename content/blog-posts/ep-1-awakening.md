Ch. 2 – The Awakening

Morning came. My alarm went off and I got up and went through my morning routine of shower, breakfast, get dressed and so on. I was brushing my teeth and when I looked up into the mirror I saw that line again. That strange static looking line. It across my line of sight and would blur when I moved my head.

Sigh _I guess it’s getting worse._ I finished getting ready and made it down to my Prius waved to my neighbor who was sitting on their front porch. Cigarette in mouth coffee in hand. The eye doctor was roughly 20 minutes away, but the line was getting worse and an eye floater suddenly appeared.

_24 and Hayes, good. Im almost there._ I was starting to worry. Another eye floater appeared and the line was gradually widening and blocking my vision. My heart was pumping faster, my anxiety was growing. Instincts finally took over and my hands pulled the car over. My body started to act on its own. Fighting for control I fell out of the front seat onto the cold pavement of the road. Body was twitching and the line grew slowly pulling itself over my eyesight. All I could see was this brown orange tint and a skin like texture until my sight was completely encompassed. My will to fight for control faded quickly… this was it.

…

“Trip! Trip!!” There was voice in the distance. “I don’t think he’s gonna wake up. Trip!!” I could feel my torso being grabbed and pushed my arms were limp but they were flopping around. I could see light opening up the line was minimizing down. As my sight was coming into focus I could see this man standing in front of me. Black hair medium length parted to one side. Strong jaw line and stubble. “Wait… his eyes they’re opening!” He said excitedly. I could feel motion as if were on a vehicle moving forward at a moderate speed the sky was this weird brown orange tint. I was lying down on the bed of of vehicle. There was no roof over us. I was prompt up against the back side the driver seat. Clouds passed as we were passing by they were dark and you could feel the weight they carried with them.

“Bout time you woke up Tripp. I was ready to call you dead.” The sound of her voice was coming behind me. I turned my head to find what was basically a female version of the man standing in front of me. Black hair roughly shoulder length. Bangs parted one side. They were both wearing padded clothing. Gloves that were cut off at the knuckles. The man had a gun slung around his back.

“Who are you?” I said. _This must be a dream._

“Tripp! You’re alive buddy. We thought we might have lost you back there.” The man said.

“What’s going on? Where am I?” I asked

“Ah… that’s right we had to wipe your memory before you went in. Just sit tight buddy we’ll get you back in no time. How far off are we Cayline?” He asked.

“were a bit away. I had to take a different route back to lose them fuckers. Get comfortable.” She replied.

“You heard her. Just sit tight Tripp. I know this is a lot to probably take in but you’ll see soon.” He replied. Kian sat back against the other side of the bed.

_Nothing made sense at all. The sky wasn’t blue. the clouds were weighted lightning was passing over them. This had to be a dream this is too surreal. But I could not wake myself up._ There was awkward pause. Kian spoke up.

“I’m sure you have a ton of questions.” He said.

“Yes. I do. For starters. Where am I?” I replied frustrated.

“Just relax Tripp. This wil—”

“And who is Tripp? And what are we riding on?”

“RELax your memory will come back soon.”

“Atleast tell me where we are going?”

“Ah. Right. Were going to see Corza. She’s the one that holds your memory and perspective. When you get that back, you’ll remember everything. And you’ll remember, in order for us to play it safe we wipe soldiers’ memories before sending them into reality.” I looked at him wide-eyed.

“Okay so I’m a soldier fighting some sort of war over what reality is?” I said. He laughed

“Don’t think too hard about it Tripp. But that’s essentially it. You’re probably thinking this is a dream.” I sighed

“Of course I do. What else would it be?” he continued laughing.

“Tripp just take it, easy. And try to take it all in. I know it’s a lot but it will come too shortly. In the meantime just try to relax and adjust.” Cayline said. We all went silient for the rest of the drive. This could not be reality.
